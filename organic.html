            Benefits of<span>Organic Food</span></h1>
            <p>Organic food refers to food products that are produced, prepared, and processed without the use of any chemicals. It means organic food production prohibits the use of chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or chemical preservatives. Consequently, organic foods are increasingly gaining popularity because a greater portion of the population wants to know its benefits. The general public belief is that organic food is healthier compared to the conventional ones, and itâ€™s the primary reason for its increased demand over the past decade.

                The choice of consuming organic foods is thus a growing trend in the world of today following the realization of healthy self improvement needs. However, finding accurate facts about organic foods has always been confusing as people have varied opinions regarding its benefits as a whole. This article defines the most accurate facts about the top  health benefits of eating organic food.
                
                </p>
            <h1>Better overall health</h1>
            <p>Because organic food is not produced or processed by the use of chemical pesticides or chemical fertilizers, it does not contain any elements of toxic chemicals and may not affect human health in harmful ways. The use of natural techniques such as green manure to fertilize the lands and crop rotation in pest and disease control work absolutely well in producing safer, healthier, and smellier final food products. Besides, healthy foodstuff simply means healthy people and better nourishment for a better living for both people and animals.</p>
            <h1>Antioxidant content</h1>
            <p>The positive effects of antioxidants on overall health have been established in a number of scientific studies, especially those derived from organic foods. This is because organic foods are free of foreign chemicals that normally react with vitamins, organic compounds and minerals thus lowering the essential positive impacts of antioxidants in food products.Latest studies propose that the consumption of organic food can contribute to more intake of nutritionally advantageous antioxidants and limited exposure to heavy metals. The positive impacts of antioxidants obtained from organic foods include prevention of heart disease, cancer, vision problems, premature aging, and cognitive malfunction.</p>
            <h1>Improved Heart condition</h1>
            <p>Exclusive grazing on natural grass increases the amounts of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) found in animal products. The suns energy is well taken in by natural grass through photosynthesis and is converted into the most desirable organic CLA by the herbivores that feed on it. CLA is a heart-healthy fatty acid with the potential of bolstering cardiovascular protection, and it is found in higher quantities in the meat and milk products of animals that have been pastured in free range.</p>
            <h1>Antibiotic resistance</h1>
            <p>Humans are susceptible to various health issues and disease, and most of the time they have to take precautionary measures to ensure they remain healthy. This is achieved by getting a variety of vaccinations and antibiotic drugs when a new strain of virus or bacteria is realized. Similarly, non-organic food sources (especially livestock and feeds) use vaccines, growth hormones, animal byproducts, and antibiotics to treat and feed the animals.When humans consume the non-organic food products, they indirectly consume the antibiotics, growth hormones and vaccines which weaken immune systems on the account of antibiotic, vaccine, hormones, and animal byproducts overdose. This may alter the immune system thereby rendering humans unable to defend themselves against diseases. The benefit of organic foods is that their production processes does not involve the use of antibiotics, growth hormones, animal byproducts, or vaccines.</p>
            <h1>Better taste</h1>
            <p>Apart from nutrition, the mineral and sugar structures in organic foods are tasty because the crops are given more time to develop and mature. The use of natural and environmentally friendly agricultural production techniques is revealed to be the reason for the better taste in organic food products. It is commonly reported that the taste of organic vegetables and fruits are of higher quality compared to those that are conventionally grown.</p>
